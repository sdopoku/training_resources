# School of Data Training Resources Repository
This repository contains a list of resources that can be used in designing and delivering School of Data trainings and content.

## Overview
School of Data's goal is to advanced data literacy across the world. A critical way we do this is through our training events and content on specific themes and for specific learners. Through years of delivering these trainings, we have developed a 3-stage process together with resources that allow us and other trainers buid the relevant content for a target audience. 

This resource lists the approach and tools we have available to develop and deliver a School of Data training. It includes pre-training, training and post-training materials such as assessment surveys, facilitators guides, datasets, slides and manuals that could be reused by other trainers.

**NB:** This is a working document which we hope to develop over time. We welcome any additions to this resource via a pull request.

## Data Pipeline
A core part of School of Data trainings and learning is the use of the [Data Pipeline](https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/) framework. This serves as a foundation for skills we believe are fundamental in developing other relevant data skills but also provides a structured method to identify and build intermediate, advanced and specialised data skills.

It is critical that any School of Data trainer understands and can master the basics of the 7 stages of the pipeline in order to communicate its nuances as well as identify new tools and techniques for the targeted learners.
