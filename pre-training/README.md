# Pre-training Resources
Each training should contain a pre-training stage. This is where the trainer tries to understand the purpose of the training, the target audience and the relevant resources to preparation to deliver an effective training.

We recommend going through the activities below given how much time is available to achieve an effective training:
+ Training Request Call
+ Training Proposal
+ Pre-training Background Survey
+ Pre-training Assessment Quiz
+ Pre-training 1-on-1 Call

# Stage 1
## Training Request Call
Training should always be meeting a skills gap need. It should either have been requested by a specific audience or an audience may be identified as requiring this training through a previous assessment. Either way, the first step should be to understand the target group's needs and what specific goals the training should achieve. This is the purpose of the training request call.

This should happen as early as possible during the planning of the training and can involve key individuals include the training funders, trainer or programme manager. The objective is to understand more about the request, available funds and timeframe for the delivery.  We have listed a number of questions worth answering during this call that will be helpful in this stage:

### Questions
+ Why is a training being requested?
+ What need is the training trying to solve?
+ Have similar trainings taken place in the past? If so, what format did they take? Is there a documentation of the process?
+ Who are the target audience for this training?
+ What are the (immediate, medium-term and long-term) objectives of the training?
+ What is the time scope or timeline for the delivery of this training?
+ What budget, personnel and resources are available to support this training?
+ What other constraints should we be aware of for this training?
+ Who will be the main point of contact for your organisation for this training?

### Outputs
+ Minutes or report of call
+ Assigned list of pending responses
+ Date for submission of training proposal

## Training Proposal
This should be the next output after the initial training call. The goal is to produce a draft document that outlines a possible structure for the requested training. The focus should be on proposal a training format that meets the objectives of the training request, time constraints and budget. It also aims at providing clarity on any pending questions but ultimately to move the trainer and requester for training close to the point of getting official approval to deliver the training.

See an example of a draft training proposal from work with Transparency International EU in 2018: [TI EU Training Proposal](./ti_training_proposal_sample.pdf)


# Stage 2

## Pre-training Background Survey

This should be the first component of the pre-assessment process with the objective of gaining a better understanding of each training participant, role, experience and training expectation. 

### Constraints or Requirements
+ Should be completed by each training participant.
+ Should not take more than 3 mins to complete.
+ Should ideally be completed at least 3 weeks before proposed training is delivered (with an exception for training engagements requested less than 3 weeks to training dates)


### Goals 
+ To learn about each participant’s background and interests.
+ To learn about each participant’s role and focus area in their chapter.
+ To understand the level of fluency of each potential participant in talking about the role that data can play in their work

+ [Pre-training Background Survey - Word Doc](./pre_training_background_survey.docx)
+ [Pre-training Background Survey Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/q3ZVwFUbifB7LBD33)

## Pre-training Quiz
This is the second stage of the pre-assessment process. 

### Goals 
+ To understand what knowledge participants already possess when working with data.
+ To understand the tools and techniques participants already use in order to decide on relevant skills to train on.
+ To group participants by level of experience.
+ To design a draft training format to be shared with learners for feedback


### Questions
This section lists some examples questions to include in the pre-training assessment quiz. Given that it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list that covers the assessment needs for all possible trainings, we list some points to pay attention to when designing this quiz. The quiz should:

+ Have variations in questions to test different grades of skills
+ Test ability to use a specific formula from a tool of choice
+ Test ability to use online help or tool documentation 
+ Emphasize goal to answer as many questions as possible. Make point about increasing difficulty of questions.
+ Test familiarity with various steps of the data pipeline using a tailored scenario  as an example. For instance, “I am a CSO working in the extractive sector…” or "I am a senior editor managing a radio station in a rural community..."
+ Test basic computer and web literacy skills
+ Use a contextualised dataset to evaluate grades of skills.

### Sample Questions
#### Section 1: Profile
1. What is your full name? **[short-answer text, required]**

2. If you have some experience working with data, what tools do you use? Please include your level of mastery of the tool. Example: Excel (advanced), OpenRefine (medium), R (beginner)? **[long-answer text, required]**

#### Section 2: Getting, Verifying & Cleaning Data
This section should provide a contextualised dataset based on results from the backgound survey that allows learners to demonstrate skills to get, verify and clean data. Below is an example template of a description for this section:

The questions in this section will be based on **[insert data set]: [insert public link to dataset]**

Download the dataset and answer the following questions.

3. The data in **[dataset table]** provided above is a PDF. In order to work with this data, we need to convert it to a format that is easy for cleaning, analysis and presentation with most tools (machine-readable format). Describe what tools or techniques you can use to make this data machine-readable. **[long-answer text, optional]**

4. Once you have the data in a machine-readable format, open it with a spreadsheet tool. Do you see any problem with the data? List each of these problems below. [long-answer text, optional]

5. After verifying and cleaning the data, save it in a machine-readable format and upload it to an online platform that can be accessed by anyone. Provid the shareable link to the data below. **[short-answer text, optional]**

#### Section 3: Data Analysis & Presentation
This section focuses on the last two stages of the data pipeline. You have a choice of continuing with the dataset from the previous section or identifying a totally different dataset for this section.

Whatever the choice, it is important to ensure that the dataset chosen has been cleaned to allow for easy analysis and presentation. For scenarios where the dataset from the previous section is going to be used, the quiz should provide a link to the cleaned version of the dataset.

Below are some example questions for this section:
