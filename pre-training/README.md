# Pre-training Resources
Each training should contain a pre-training stage. This is where the trainer tries to understand the purpose of the training, the target audience and the relevant resources to preparation to deliver an effective training.

We recommend going through the activities below given how much time is available to achieve an effective training:
+ Training Request Call
+ Training Proposal
+ Pre-training Background Survey
+ Pre-training Assessment Quiz
+ Pre-training 1-on-1 Call

## Training Request Call
Training should always be meeting a skills gap need. It should either have been requested by a specific audience or an audience may be identified as requiring this training through a previous assessment. Either way, the first step should be to understand the target group's needs and what specific goals the training should achieve. This is the purpose of the training request call.

This should happen as early as possible during the planning of the training and can involve key individuals include the training funders, trainer or programme manager. The objective is to understand more about the request, available funds and timeframe for the delivery.  We have listed a number of questions worth answering during this call that will be helpful in this stage:

### Questions
+ Why is a training being requested?
+ What need is the training trying to solve?
+ Have similar trainings taken place in the past? If so, what format did they take? Is there a documentation of the process?
+ Who are the target audience for this training?
+ What are the (immediate, medium-term and long-term) objectives of the training?
+ What is the time scope or timeline for the delivery of this training?
+ What budget, personnel and resources are available to support this training?
+ What other constraints should we be aware of for this training?
+ Who will be the main point of contact for your organisation for this training?

### Outputs
+ Minutes or report of call
+ Assigned list of pending responses
+ Date for submission of training proposal

## Training Proposal
This should be the next output after the initial training call. The goal is to produce a draft document that outlines a possible structure for the requested training. The focus should be on proposal a training format that meets the objectives of the training request, time constraints and budget. It also aims at providing clarity on any pending questions but ultimately to move the trainer and requester for training close to the point of getting official approval to deliver the training.
